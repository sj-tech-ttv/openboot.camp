								<p>Bootcamps can be predatory. They charge you an arm and a leg to develop skills that may or may not land you a job. Even if you find a bootcamp that guarantees attendees a job, this guarantee is usually that you don’t have to pay if you don’t find a job. If you do find a job, they require you to pay them a percentage of your salary should you land a job. This model can lead you to grossly overpay, or it can lead you to simply not getting a job in tech.</p>
								<p>Most of the skills taught at bootcamps are based on free and Open Source software that’s standard across the tech industry. The documentation’s free to read, even if it is written in language that’s opaque to the average person.</p>
								<p>That’s where we come in. OpenBootCamp has free courses to teach you the basics of how to use and develop software using the technologies used by companies around the world, and we’re not charging a dime.</p>
								<p>How do we plan to stay free in the face of Big Bootcamp? Through the kindness and compassion of companies that benefit from our work and students who have completed our course. We work based on donations. Right now, we’re in beta (or really, pre-alpha, as we have no content whatsoever) but someday we will start asking for donations.</p>
