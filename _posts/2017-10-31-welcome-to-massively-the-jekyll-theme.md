Hello and Welcome! The purpose of this project is to provide an alternative to paid coding boot camps and similar tech education. Paid bootcamps cost a lot, and there’s no guarantee that your instructor and course will even provide you with the information you need to succeed, or that the bootcamp will provide you with the skills you need to land a job in tech. Some bootcamps even take a percentage of your salary after you graduate, which can be predatory. Often, you don’t have anything to show for your experience in a bootcamp other than a certificate, making potential new employers skeptical that the bootcamp taught anything at all. All of this makes for a bad experience for bootcamp attendees.

My goal is to create a bootcamp that’s more accessible. All content related to this bootcamp is freely available across this website, Twitch, Youtube, and Discord. By the end of the bootcamp, you should have a portfolio of projects you can show potential future employers and the skills to get through an entry level tech interview. I’d like to keep all this freely available to anyone who’s interested, and for now, I’m working for donations. To donate, check out https://sj.coffee. DO NOT DO THIS RIGHT NOW, I AM STILL NAILING DOWN THE CURRICULUM AND YOU ARE A GUINEA PIG, WHICH IS PAYMENT ENOUGH

Keep in mind that a bootcamp isn’t a replacement for a Computer Science degree. It skims over a lot of the deeper concepts that a degree would give you in favor of getting you used to writing code with less knowledge. This can help bootcamp attendees be effective at some jobs sooner, but it does mean that some jobs won’t be accessible to bootcamp attendees immediately after graduation. This isn’t a problem that we’re trying to solve with this bootcamp, we are trying to get people into the tech industry sooner, so they can learn these things from their coworkers with degrees. That isn’t to say that those jobs will always be inaccessible to bootcamp attendees. A bootcamp is intended to be a springboard to a larger career in tech, but growth requires further learning. Always be on the lookout for more learning opportunities, and take them as you can.

All that said, I hope this gives you some insight into what we plan to do with this bootcamp, and I hope it’s something you’d be interested in doing! We hope to see you at our weekly streams!
