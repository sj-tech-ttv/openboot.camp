## About Us

Hi, I'm SJ! I've been working in tech in various capacities for around 15 years. I've worked for companies ranging in size from a 10 person startup, to 3 of the Fortune 5, with plenty of companies in between those extremes. I've done everything from desktop support and sales to software development, devops, security, and lots more. I never finished my college degree, instead I quit my computer science program after 2 years. I learned the skills I needed for various jobs in tech through years of experimentation, curiosity, and reading stuff other people have posted online. I'd like to teach you how to do the same thing, and help people break into tech. In my free time, I like to bake bread, garden, fish, and go on adventures on my motorcycle.
